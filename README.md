# Summary

### Introduction
---
One of the most difficult aspects of Neural Networks
is developing their structure. Hand-design requires a large
number of human resources and for this reason NAS algorithms
have been created to automate this process. These methods are
extremely slow, requiring a full training for each observed model.
To expedite this process, various quick-to-compute measures can
be used instead of training to evaluate networks. In this paper, we
evaluate two of these metrics (NASWOT and Synflow) and test
several search algorithms in order to determine the optimum
network configuration for image classification of three distinct
datasets using the Nats-Bench in a matter of minutes.

### Searchspace
---
In our experiments, we explored the NATS-bench search
space. The skeleton is initiated with one 3x3
convolution with 16 output channels and a batch normalization
layer. The main body of the skeleton includes three stacks of
cells connected by a residual block. The shortcut path in this
residual block consists of a 2x2 average pooling layer with a
stride of 2 and a 1x1 convolution. The skeleton ends up with
a global average pooling layer.
